# Cowlytic Platform

A modern web application built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Description

This app helps people—especially farmers, veterinarians, and livestock managers—monitor the health and activity of their animals, detect issues early, save time and labor, and make better decisions using real-time data and insights. It’s especially useful in large or remote farms where constant manual monitoring is difficult.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
